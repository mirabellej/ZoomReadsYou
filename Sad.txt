"You seem sad. ",
"Maybe you're a little glum but isn't today another day? ",
"You seem a little unhappy.  ",
"Are you breathing enough? ",
"You frown.  ",
"Are you feeling emotional?  ",
"Don't be sad.  ",
"There there. This is a time to get it all out.  ",
"Most people aren't as sensitive as you. ",
"You frown, the corners of your mouth pulling sharply downwards as a heaviness settles upon you. ",
"Don't worry. It's not too long, now, fortunately. ",
"You sulk. Why should you bother getting to know this person any differently from the rest of your life? ",
"Are you disappointed with this? ",
"But, at the same time, you also feel a certain dismay; just when you were beginning to grow truly interested. ",
"And so you see this story so tightly interwoven with sensations suddenly riven by bottomless chasms, as if the claim to portray vital fullness revealed the void beneath. ",
"You despair. Is this all futile? ",
"Obviously your interest in the surroundings are intermittent; it follows the difficulty of your days, the ups and downs of your moods. ",
"Are you depressive or euphoric?  ",
"Perhaps it is the weather that is bothering you. ",
"That's the long and short of it, isn't it? The void all around us is more and more void. ",
"Does that make you sad? ",
"Those frown lines you see every morning, getting deeper, running from each corner of your mouth down to the edge of your chin, those are called marionette lines. ",
"You're a bit glum but remember: this could or could not be the worst day of your life.  ",
"Don't be so sad. There will be other days, some better and some worse than today.  ",
"Your heart sinks. ",
"Lately, you have accumulated few gold stars.  ",
"You try and you try and you try. ",
"You're already exhausted today. ",
"There are times when your heart’s not in it. ",
"You sulk. Why would anyone want to? ",
"You’re crushed. Utterly, utterly crushed."
