# ZoomReadsYou
Browser-based Javascript application created for Nordic Summer University's Cybiosis Symposium. </br></br>
What would a story based on your Zoom presence sound like?</br></br>
To answer this question, I (a creative writer and programmer) have created the following program. </br></br>
The program produces an audible narrative that is generated based on expression tracking over a web stream. </br></br>
The audible text (selected at runtime) is composed by a combination of living and dead authors as well as an artificial intelligence - GPT2.</br></br>
This program uses FaceAPI.js to recognize 7 expressions including: happy, sad, neutral, disgusted, fearful, surprised angry and output corresponding text using HTML5 text to speech.</br></br>
This program will only work with a secure server (https://) and local host only due to browser-imposed restrictions on the getUserMedia method. </br></br>
</br></br>
This is an open source project built on open sourced projects. </br></br>
