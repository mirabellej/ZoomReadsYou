Browser-based Javascript application created for Nordic Summer Universities Cybiosis Symposium. </br></br>
An audible narrative is generated based on expression tracking over a web stream. </br></br>
The audible text is written by a combination of living and dead authors and GPT2.</br></br>
Uses FaceAPI.js to recognize 7 expressions including: happy, sad, neutral, disgusted, fearful, surprised angry.</br></br>
Works with secure server (https://) and local host only due to browser-imposed restrictions on the getUserMedia method. </br></br>
</br></br>
This is an open source project built on open sourced projects. </br></br>
