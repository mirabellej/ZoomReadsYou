"You frown, the corners of your mouth pulling sharply downwards as a heaviness settles upon you. ",
"You contort your face in disgust.  ",

"An interrogative flash passes in your gaze.  ",
"A look of abject disgust crosses your face.  ",

"You grimace. ",
"Your face contorts at the thought. ",
"Your skin tenses. ",
"You contort your face. ",
"Your face contorts in confusion. ",
"Obviously, you don't want to."
