Are you truly listening?
==========
Mouth clamped shut, you stare straight ahead.
==========
You settle into your seat and listen to the words coming from your computer, synthesized words, the words of the other.
==========
Today is another day. 
==========
You imagine the carefree winds sweeping across the plains of some far off place and think about the vicissitudes of history.
==========
This is not what you expected to be doing with your time.
==========
You’re unimpressed but when was the last time you were truly impressed?
==========
In your mind, you search for the last time you felt this way. 
==========
You become vividly aware of your own breathing, the forces required to keep your body in operation: blood and air, so many systems and processes collaborating towards your consciousness.
==========
Are you breathing enough?
==========
You give it some thought. 
==========
That sensation you felt earlier has largely subsided.
==========
You glance at yourself.
==========
You examine yourself: reading the texture of your skin, scanning the depth of your gaze, investigating each line in your face.
==========
This is a time to get it all out. 
==========
Strong forces are at work.
==========
Such tantalizing insights are to be found when we are alone and asked to speak with ourselves.
==========
Perhaps there's an important lesson to learn here. 
==========
Suddenly you've found your energy again.
==========
You may be a bit daunted by all that’s happened to you and all that is yet to happen.
==========
You may need to erect a mental barrier.
==========
You get the feeling that other people don't really care as much as you thought they did. 
==========
You wonder how easy it is for someone to tell what you’re thinking just by looking at you.
==========
You think
==========
Most people aren't as sensitive as you. 
==========
You frown
==========
You look at
==========
You smile
==========
Don't withhold your opinions.
==========
If you were to get up and leave right now, how would that make you feel?
==========
You think hard, arranging everything in order of priority. 
==========
But you need hardly any time to reach a conclusion. 
==========
Things are not what they seem, you repeat mentally.
==========
Every muscle in your body tenses. 
==========
You contort your face.
==========
You are hesitant and uncertain.
==========
